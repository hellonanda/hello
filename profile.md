## üìö Knowledge Base

### CI/CD Security
- Secure CI/CD practices  
- Integrating SAST, DAST, Dependency Scanning  
- Securing pipelines: credentials protection, signed artifacts  
- Example Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, OWASP Dependency-Check

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
- Secure Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM Templates  
- Tools: tfsec, Checkov, terrascan  
- Best Practices: least privilege IAM roles, encrypted storage, security group hardening  
- Example: Terraform security scanning GitHub workflow

### Cloud Security
- Securing AWS, Azure, GCP environments  
- IAM best practices  
- Encryption at rest/in transit using KMS  
- Cloud native tools: AWS Config, Azure Security Center, GCP Security Center  
- Threat detection services: GuardDuty, Security Command Center

### Kubernetes Security
- Cluster hardening: PodSecurity Standards, API server flags, RBAC best practices  
- Network Policies & Service Mesh for micro-segmentation  
- Secrets management  
- Admission Controllers (OPA/Gatekeeper)  
- Example: PodSecurityAdmission implementation in Kubernetes 1.25+

### Supply Chain Security
- Software supply chain risks  
- SBOM tools: Syft, Trivy  
- Artifact signing & verification: cosign, SLSA  
- Monitoring dependencies: Dependabot, Renovate

### Secure Coding Practices
- CIS Rules, OWASP Top 10 2021  
- Secure input validation, output encoding, session management  
- Threat modeling (STRIDE, DREAD)

### Secrets Management
- Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager  
- Dynamic secrets & auto-rotation  
- Avoid secrets in source code (git-secrets, detect-secrets)

---

## üìú Runbooks

### Pipeline Hardening
- Runners isolation, artifact signing, secrets management checklist

### Vault + Kubernetes Integration
- HashiCorp Vault with Kubernetes auth method  
- Auto-injecting secrets into pods

### Patch Management for Containers
- Regular image scans  
- Rebuilding containers on base image updates  
- Tools: Trivy, Grype

### Compliance as Code
- OPA/Rego, Checkov for security policy enforcement

### Automated Penetration Testing
- Scheduling OWASP ZAP  
- Reporting vulnerabilities

### Incident Response Guide
- 30-minute playbook: first steps, incident logging, escalation matrix
